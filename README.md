# vulnapp-python

Intentional Vulnerable Python Application - Used only for tests in AquilaX

## Purpose

This repository serves as a test target for the AquilaX security scanner suite. It contains intentional vulnerabilities and license violations to verify scanner detection capabilities.

---

## Security Vulnerabilities

The application includes the following **code-level vulnerabilities**:

| Vulnerability | Location | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| **SQL Injection** | `/add_post` route | User input directly inserted into SQL query without sanitization |
| **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** | `/view_post/<id>` route | User input rendered without proper escaping |
| **Hardcoded Credentials** | `app.py` | Admin credentials hardcoded in source code |
| **Path Traversal** | `/exec_command` route | Input not sanitized, allows arbitrary path access |
| **Code Injection** | `/exec_command` route | Executes user-supplied input as system command |
| **XSRF** | All forms | No CSRF protection implemented |

---

## Docker Container

The `Dockerfile` includes:
- Python 3.11 slim base image
- System packages with various licenses (bash, coreutils - GPL)
- All Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`

---

## Running the Application

```bash
# Local development
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Docker
docker build -t vulnapp-python .
docker run -p 5000:5000 vulnapp-python
```

---

## Scanner Testing

Install AquilaX CLI: [Docs](https://docs.aquilax.ai/user-manual/devtools/aquilax-cli#install)

```bash
# Run AquilaX scan
aquilax scan https://github.com/AquilaX-AI/vulnapp-python --sync
```
